# 10-monkey-species-kaggle

## About the notebook:
1. Given the very less number of examples, training a classification model from scratch will only take us so far. So, I have opted to use transfer learning approach.
2. I have also tried transfer learning with VGG-16. I couldn't get fbeta score of above 0.914 with that architecture. Transfer learning because the dataset is so small(only 1,098 train examples.)
3. I had tried batch sizes from 4 to 64 and it's batch size of 16, that worked.

And yes, I have removed all the cells in this notebook that I tried above things in, for better understanding.
